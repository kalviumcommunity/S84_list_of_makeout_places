"List of Makeout Places in Our Campus"

📜 Project Overview

This project is a crowdsourced platform where users can discover, contribute, and rate the best makeout spots on campus. It offers a personalized experience, allowing users to submit locations, provide anonymous reviews, and vote on the most romantic or secluded spots. The aim is to create a fun, interactive, and private space while implementing essential web development concepts like databases, APIs, authentication, and deployment in a beginner-friendly manner.

🏗 This project will help me learn:

✅ How to build a full-stack web application from scratch.
✅ How to create and manage a database.
✅ How to design and test RESTful APIs.
✅ How to handle user authentication and security.
✅ How to deploy both frontend and backend applications.
